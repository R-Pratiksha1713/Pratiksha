3.VARIDHI MADHURANATH       1KS18CS111

2.CONTRIBUTION OF EACH TEAM MEMBER:
a)R.PRATIKSHA:
Applying the basic math operations and implementing the source code.Look through the hardcoding of inputs.
b)SINDU.A.S:
Suggested various approaches to solve the problem in a better way.
c)VARIDHI MADHURANATH:
Correction of errors and validating the correctness of code.

3.INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
a)Create a file with set of both positive and negative integers in a text editor.
b)Execute the program as "./a.out filename.txt"

4.DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT:
Example:
Input:2,-3,1.5,-1,3,-2,-3,3
Output:3.5 is the amximum subsequence in 10 instruction

5.CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW DID YOU ADDRESS THESE:
a)Using the concept of files in the problem was a bit challenging,everyone had to involve in learning the concepts of file and then implementing the entire source code.
b)Accessing each and every element using files was learnt from external sources by surfing through the internet.
c)Solving the problem in O(1) time complexity.
d)The issue of feof was quite challenging.

6.WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:
a)The proper usage of files and accesing the elements from a file.
b)How to convert the input in file which is a string to floating point and access the elements.
c)Improving the efficiency of program.
