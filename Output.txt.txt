1.OUTPUT OF PROGRAM WITH SAMPLE DATA:
The output would display the maximum sum subsequence.
Example:
Input:100,-87,948.9,-87,-945,9357,-9.89,567,-9.8
Output:9914.1100
	

2.TOTAL NUMBER OF BASIC OPERATIONS i.e., COMPUTATION OF TIME COMPLEXITY:
a)The basic operations are comaprision and addition.
b)The time complexity of the problem is O(n).
